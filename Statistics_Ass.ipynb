    "# Statistics can be broadly categorized into two main types: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Here are examples of each type:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Descriptive Statistics:Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset without drawing inferences or making predictions. They help in organizing and presenting data in a meaningful way. Some common descriptive statistics include:\n",
    "# a.Mean: The average value of a set of numbers. For example, the mean of the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 is (2+4+6+8+10)/5 = 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "# b.Median: The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. For example, the median of 3, 5, 2, 8, and 1 is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "# c.Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset. For example, in the set of numbers 2, 3, 3, 4, and 5, the mode is 3.\n",
    "# 2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a.Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. For example, in the numbers 10, 15, 5, 20, and 25, the range is 25 - 5 = 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "# b.Variance: A measure of how data points deviate from the mean. It is calculated as the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "# c.Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, which provides a measure of the spread or dispersion of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Graphical Representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a.Histogram: A graphical representation of the distribution of data, typically used for continuous data. It consists of bars that represent the frequency or count of data within certain intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# b. Bar Chart: A chart that uses bars to represent data in categories or groups. It is often used for discrete or categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Inferential Statistics:Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions, make predictions, and test hypotheses about a population based on a sample of data. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a. Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "# t-test: Used to compare means between two groups and determine if the difference is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chi-squared test: Used to test the independence of categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# b. Confidence Intervals:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which a population parameter is likely to fall. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the average height of a population might be 65 inches ± 2 inches.\n",
    "# c. Regression Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Linear regression: Used to model the relationship between two or more variables, with the goal of making predictions or understanding correlations.\n",
